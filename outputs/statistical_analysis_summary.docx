Statistical Analysis of Relationships Between Exposures, Covariates, and Outcomes

1. Pearson/Spearman Correlation Analysis

The following section summarizes the results of Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses conducted to assess the strength and direction of relationships between demographic covariates (e.g., Age, Monthly household income) and dependent variables (Emotional Support, Informational Support, Instrumental Support T Scores). The strength of association is interpreted using the correlation coefficient (r), and statistical significance is determined by the p-value.

Conclusion
----------
The statistical analyses reveal several significant associations between demographic and socioeconomic covariates and the key outcome variables (emotional, informational, and instrumental support, as well as self-concept domains). Age, marital status, employment status, health insurance coverage, and participation in community activities consistently show significant relationships with various support and self-concept outcomes. Income and education also demonstrate associations in specific domains. These findings highlight the multifactorial nature of social support and self-concept among Indian females, emphasizing the importance of both demographic and social determinants in shaping psychosocial well-being.
